# Hollywood-Classic-Films-Website-Refactoring

This is an assignment I completed as part of the Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN program at MIT. 

This repository contains the refactored codebase for the Hollywood Classic Films website. The website is a single-page application built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It provides information about classic films, showcases products, and includes a checkout feature for purchasing.

# Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

# Prerequisites
You need to have a modern web browser installed (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Edge).

# Installing
Clone this repository to your local machine using https://github.com/Lizsei/hollywood-classic-films.git
Open the index.html file in your web browser.

# Refactoring Process

The refactoring process was aimed at improving the structure of the codebase, enhancing the user interface, and optimizing for better performance. Below are the primary changes that were made during the refactoring:

Bootstrap Integration: The original website was built using basic HTML and CSS. The website has been refactored to use Bootstrap, a popular CSS framework, for better responsiveness and ease of styling.
Code Structure: The HTML and CSS code has been restructured and cleaned up to enhance readability and maintainability. This includes properly indenting lines, removing redundant code, and adding comments.
Performance Optimization: Images have been optimized for faster load times without compromising their quality. Also, scripts and stylesheets have been properly placed for faster rendering.
User Interface Enhancements: The website's interface has been enhanced with modern styles for a better user experience. This includes adding hover effects on links, improving the color scheme, and creating a structured layout for the cart and checkout areas.
